Dialogue: 0,0:29:42.78,0:29:45.66,ENG,,0,0,0,,a normal distribution does kind of come about...
Dialogue: 0,0:29:42.78,0:29:45.66,CHN,,0,0,0,,正态分布似乎还是会出现……
Dialogue: 0,0:29:46.32,0:29:49.28,ENG,,0,0,0,,Part of the reason might be that there are generalizations of the theorem
Dialogue: 0,0:29:46.32,0:29:49.28,CHN,,0,0,0,,部分原因是中心极限定理有更通用的形式
Dialogue: 0,0:29:49.28,0:29:52.50,ENG,,0,0,0,,beyond the scope of this video that relax these assumptions,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:49.28,0:29:52.50,CHN,,0,0,0,,可以放宽这些假设

Dialogue: 0,0:29:57.18,0:30:00.30,ENG,,0,0,0,,people seem to assume that a variable is normally distributed

Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.30,0:30:03.00,CHN,,0,0,0,,人们似乎也会默认这个变量服从正态分布

Dialogue: 0,0:30:14.98,0:30:18.30,ENG,,0,0,0,,but in certain situations where you have an infinite set of outcomes,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:14.98,0:30:18.30,CHN,,0,0,0,,但比如当结果的范围是无限的时候
