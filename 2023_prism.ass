Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.88,ENG,,0,0,0,,I realized recently that I didn't really understand how a prism works,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.88,ZH,,0,0,0,,最近我发现自己并没有真正理解棱镜是怎么工作的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.88,0:00:06.46,ENG,,0,0,0,,and I suspect most people out there don't either.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.88,0:00:06.46,ZH,,0,0,0,,我猜大多数人也不大理解
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.34,0:00:15.55,ENG,,0,0,0,,Arguably this is one of the most widely recognized physics experiments ever.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.34,0:00:15.55,ZH,,0,0,0,,从某种意义上来说 这是最广为人知的物理实验之一
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.55,0:00:19.43,ENG,,0,0,0,,After all, how many others have earned a place as an iconic album cover?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.55,0:00:19.43,ZH,,0,0,0,,毕竟 有多少实验能成为专辑封面呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.71,0:00:24.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,Sure, some of Pink Floyd's design choices run completely contrary to the actual physics.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.71,0:00:24.12,ZH,,0,0,0,,当然 Pink Floyd 的一些设计是违背物理学规律的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.12,0:00:27.51,ENG,,0,0,0,,Like why did they make the light inside the prism white?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.12,0:00:27.51,ZH,,0,0,0,,比如说 为什么要把棱镜里的光设计成白色呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.51,0:00:31.13,ENG,,0,0,0,,And bafflingly, why would you draw all the colors as a discrete set,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.51,0:00:31.13,ZH,,0,0,0,,更令人费解的是 为什么要像小孩子画彩虹一样

Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.92,0:00:44.67,ENG,,0,0,0,,Still, setting that aside, it's cool that it's in pop culture at all,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.92,0:00:44.67,ZH,,0,0,0,,但不管怎样 这个实验能在流行文化中出现就已经很酷了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.67,0:00:48.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,and any self-respecting physics enthusiast should know how it works,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.67,0:00:48.56,ZH,,0,0,0,,而且每个合格的物理爱好者  都应该知道它是怎么工作的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.56,0:00:53.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,but the thing I realized is that my understanding hit a wall pretty quickly if pressed.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.56,0:00:53.18,ZH,,0,0,0,,但我发现  如果深究起来  我的理解很快就会遇到瓶颈

Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.98,0:00:59.66,ENG,,0,0,0,,what you might hear in a high school physics class for example, goes something like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.98,0:00:59.66,ZH,,0,0,0,,例如高中物理课上教的  可能会说
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.26,0:01:04.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,When light enters a medium, like glass, it slows down,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.26,0:01:04.18,ZH,,0,0,0,,光在进入诸如玻璃的介质时会减速
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.18,0:01:06.88,ENG,,0,0,0,,in the sense that if you look at the crests of the wave,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.18,0:01:06.88,ZH,,0,0,0,,也就是说  这些光波的波峰
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.88,0:01:10.24,ENG,,0,0,0,,in a vacuum those crests are traveling at c, the speed of light,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.88,0:01:10.24,ZH,,0,0,0,,在真空中会以光速 c 传播
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.64,0:01:14.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,but inside the glass those crests will be traveling a little bit slower.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.64,0:01:14.16,ZH,,0,0,0,,而在玻璃中则会传播得稍微慢一点
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.65,0:01:16.33,ENG,,0,0,0,,And the specific ratio
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.33,0:01:20.38,ENG,,0,0,0,,between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed inside a medium like this
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.65,0:01:20.38,ZH,,0,0,0,,而真空中的光速和介质中的光速的比值
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.38,0:01:23.54,ENG,,0,0,0,,is called the index of refraction for that medium.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.38,0:01:23.54,ZH,,0,0,0,,就是这个介质的折射率
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.13,0:01:27.98,ENG,,0,0,0,,The reason we use the word refraction instead of the index of slowing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.13,0:01:27.98,ZH,,0,0,0,,我们采用“折射率”而不是“减速率”这个词
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.32,0:01:31.46,ENG,,0,0,0,,is that if a beam of light enters this glass at an angle,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.32,0:01:31.46,ZH,,0,0,0,,是因为当一束光斜着进入玻璃
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.46,0:01:35.46,ENG,,0,0,0,,then a consequence of this slowdown is that it bends a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.46,0:01:35.46,ZH,,0,0,0,,这种减速会使这束光被略微偏折
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.86,0:01:38.07,ENG,,0,0,0,,or using the lingo, it refracts.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.86,0:01:38.07,ZH,,0,0,0,,用专业术语说就是 它发生了折射
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.57,0:01:41.10,ENG,,0,0,0,,The way my high school physics teacher always explained this

Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.42,0:01:53.77,ENG,,0,0,0,,then as one of its treads hits the slow region first,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.42,0:01:53.77,ZH,,0,0,0,,那么当它的一条履带先进入慢区域时
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.77,0:01:55.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,that tread will be going slower
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.77,0:01:55.18,ZH,,0,0,0,,那条履带就会变慢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.18,0:01:58.64,ENG,,0,0,0,,while the other one is faster, causing the whole tank to steer a little bit
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.18,0:01:58.64,ZH,,0,0,0,,这样一来另一条履带就会相对较快  导致整个坦克转向
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.64,0:02:01.36,ENG,,0,0,0,,until that second tread also enters the mud, then it continues straight
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.64,0:02:01.36,ZH,,0,0,0,,直到另一边的履带进入泥地以后  坦克才会继续直行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.36,0:02:04.19,ENG,,0,0,0,,just traveling a little slower.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.36,0:02:04.19,ZH,,0,0,0,,只是行驶速度变慢了一点
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.76,0:02:07.34,ENG,,0,0,0,,We'll get back to the actual reason for bending in a bit,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.76,0:02:07.34,ZH,,0,0,0,,而折射的实际原因我们稍后会说到
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.34,0:02:10.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,but at this point the high school physics students typically learn a law
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.34,0:02:10.82,ZH,,0,0,0,,在教这个的时候  高中物理学生通常会学到一个定律
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.82,0:02:12.32,ENG,,0,0,0,,known as Snell's law
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.82,0:02:12.32,ZH,,0,0,0,,叫做斯涅尔定律
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.32,0:02:14.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,which specifies exactly how much things bend.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.32,0:02:14.92,ZH,,0,0,0,,可以准确算出光束会有多大角度偏折
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.38,0:02:19.14,ENG,,0,0,0,,If you draw a line perpendicular to the boundary between the glass and water,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.38,0:02:19.14,ZH,,0,0,0,,如果画一条垂直于玻璃和水界面的线
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.14,0:02:23.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,and consider the angle between that perpendicular line and the beam of light,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.73,0:02:29.25,ENG,,0,0,0,,the sine of this angle divided by the speed of the light is always a constant.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.73,0:02:29.25,ZH,,0,0,0,,这个角度的正弦值除以光速始终是一个常数
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.80,0:02:32.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,So the slower the light, the lower that angle will be,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.80,0:02:32.82,ZH,,0,0,0,,所以光速越慢  这个角度就越小
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.82,0:02:35.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,and that lets you calculate how much things refract.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.82,0:02:35.44,ZH,,0,0,0,,也就由此可以算出光束会发生多大的折射
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.15,0:02:38.06,ENG,,0,0,0,,What's going on with a prism, then,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.15,0:02:38.06,ZH,,0,0,0,,而棱镜的原理通常是这样解释的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.06,0:02:43.36,ENG,,0,0,0,,is that the specific amount that light slows down depends a little bit on its frequency.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.06,0:02:43.36,ZH,,0,0,0,,光减速的程度部分取决于它的频率
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.85,0:02:47.35,ENG,,0,0,0,,For example, blue light, which has a relatively high frequency,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.85,0:02:47.35,ZH,,0,0,0,,例如  频率相对较高的蓝光
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.35,0:02:50.45,ENG,,0,0,0,,would get slowed down more aggressively than red light,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.35,0:02:50.45,ZH,,0,0,0,,会比频率相对较低的红光
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.45,0:02:52.45,ENG,,0,0,0,,which has a relatively low frequency.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.45,0:02:52.45,ZH,,0,0,0,,被更大幅地减速
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.91,0:02:56.15,ENG,,0,0,0,,Most of the light you see is not a clean pure sine wave,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.91,0:02:56.15,ZH,,0,0,0,,你看到的大部分光不是纯净的正弦波
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.15,0:02:59.93,ENG,,0,0,0,,in particular the white light coming from the sun is not a clean sine wave,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.15,0:02:59.93,ZH,,0,0,0,,来自太阳的白光也不是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.93,0:03:01.47,ENG,,0,0,0,,it's something much messier,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.93,0:03:01.47,ZH,,0,0,0,,它的波形更为复杂
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.47,0:03:05.02,ENG,,0,0,0,,but it can be expressed as a sum of a bunch of clean sine waves,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.47,0:03:05.02,ZH,,0,0,0,,但可以表示为一系列光谱颜色
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.02,0:03:07.85,ENG,,0,0,0,,each one corresponding to a pure spectral color.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.53,0:03:22.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,So that is the standard explanation, and it's not wrong per se,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.53,0:03:22.48,ZH,,0,0,0,,这是常规的解释  它本身并没有错
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.48,0:03:26.49,ENG,,0,0,0,,it's just that all of the key components are handed down from on high.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.48,0:03:26.49,ZH,,0,0,0,,只是所有的关键部分都是突然从天而降的

Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.56,0:14:39.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,And then similarly think of that second wave
Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.56,0:14:39.72,ZH,,0,0,0,,然后同样地把第二个波

Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.18,0:14:46.67,ZH,,0,0,0,,波的振幅还是向量的长度
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.67,0:14:50.66,ENG,,0,0,0,,and the phase of the wave tells us the initial angle of that vector.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.67,0:14:50.66,ZH,,0,0,0,,波的相位还是向量的初始角度
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.72,0:14:55.03,ENG,,0,0,0,,Now to think about the sum of the two waves,

Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.33,0:15:46.33,ENG,,0,0,0,,so kind of a quarter cycle out of sync,
