Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.81,ENG,,0,0,0,,The setup here starts with a cylinder full of sugar water basically
Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.81,CHN,,0,0,0,,这个装置基本上先是一个装满糖水的圆柱
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.81,0:00:06.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,and we're about to shine some white light into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.81,0:00:06.52,CHN,,0,0,0,,我们准备拿白光来照它
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.52,0:00:10.68,ENG,,0,0,0,,But before it gets there, it passes through a linearly polarizing filter.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.52,0:00:10.68,CHN,,0,0,0,,但光线到达圆柱之前  要先通过一个线偏振片
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.68,0:00:12.47,ENG,,0,0,0,,And what that means basically
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.68,0:00:12.47,CHN,,0,0,0,,简单来说就是
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.47,0:00:16.34,ENG,,0,0,0,,is that if you look at all of the light waves beyond the point of that filter
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.47,0:00:16.34,CHN,,0,0,0,,若观测通过偏振片后的所有光波
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.34,0:00:20.41,ENG,,0,0,0,,those waves are only going to be wiggling in one direction, say up and down.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.34,0:00:20.41,CHN,,0,0,0,,会发现那些波都只沿一个方向振荡  比如上下振荡
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.74,0:00:24.27,ENG,,0,0,0,,And don't worry, in a few minutes we're going to go into much more detail about
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.74,0:00:24.27,CHN,,0,0,0,,别着急  我们很快将会更仔细地探讨
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.27,0:00:25.73,ENG,,0,0,0,,what specifically is wiggling
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.27,0:00:25.73,CHN,,0,0,0,,具体是什么在振荡
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.73,0:00:28.90,ENG,,0,0,0,,and what the significance of that wiggling direction is
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.73,0:00:28.90,CHN,,0,0,0,,以及振荡方向为何重要
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.90,0:00:30.62,ENG,,0,0,0,,but skipping to the punch line first
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.90,0:00:30.62,CHN,,0,0,0,,但我们先跳到重点
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.62,0:00:35.27,ENG,,0,0,0,,the demo also includes a second linearly polarizing filter coming out the other end
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.62,0:00:35.27,CHN,,0,0,0,,这个装置的另一端还有第二个线偏振片
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.27,0:00:38.54,ENG,,0,0,0,,and I want you to predict what we're going to see once we turn the light on.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.27,0:00:38.54,CHN,,0,0,0,,我想请你预测一下  开灯后我们会看到什么
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.93,0:00:43.15,ENG,,0,0,0,,Now I suspect some viewers might already have a little bit of a sense for what's going on
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.93,0:00:43.15,CHN,,0,0,0,,我猜一些观众也许已经有点头绪了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.15,0:00:46.54,ENG,,0,0,0,,because a few years ago Steve Mould made a really excellent video
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.15,0:00:46.54,CHN,,0,0,0,,因为几年前  Steve Mould 做了一期非常棒的视频
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.54,0:00:50.49,ENG,,0,0,0,,about this phenomenon of shining polarized light through sugar water.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.54,0:00:50.49,CHN,,0,0,0,,讲的就是偏振光经过糖水的这个现象
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.49,0:00:54.49,ENG,,0,0,0,,It was really well done, which is no surprise because everything Steve makes is.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.49,0:00:54.49,CHN,,0,0,0,,视频非常好  毕竟 Steve 出品必属精品
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.49,0:00:59.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,But even if you watched that, this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's still more to be explained.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.49,0:00:59.18,CHN,,0,0,0,,但就算你看过那个视频  这个丰富的现象仍有需要解释的地方
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.18,0:01:01.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,In fact even if you you made that video
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.18,0:01:01.48,CHN,,0,0,0,,甚至就算你本人做了那期视频
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.48,0:01:04.49,ENG,,0,0,0,,this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's more to be explained.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.48,0:01:04.49,CHN,,0,0,0,,这个丰富的现象依然有需要解释的地方
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.76,0:01:07.04,ENG,,0,0,0,,I'm curious Steve, when you made that video
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.76,0:01:07.04,CHN,,0,0,0,,Steve 我很好奇  当你做视频的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.04,0:01:10.05,ENG,,0,0,0,,did you happen to get a good view of the side of the glass
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.04,0:01:10.05,CHN,,0,0,0,,有没有好好地看圆柱的侧面呢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.05,0:01:13.30,ENG,,0,0,0,,probably when the rest of the lights in the room were off or something like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.05,0:01:13.30,CHN,,0,0,0,,例如  关掉房间里其他灯再看  什么的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.80,0:01:17.22,ENG,,0,0,0,,No, no, I didn't think about the side view.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.80,0:01:17.22,CHN,,0,0,0,,{\3c&H005040&}没有  没有  我没想过要看侧边
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.66,0:01:20.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,Great, so given the setup that we're looking at now
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.66,0:01:20.52,CHN,,0,0,0,,好嘞  那么你看看这一套装置
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.52,0:01:23.50,ENG,,0,0,0,,once we turn off the room lights and turn on the lamp
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.52,0:01:23.50,CHN,,0,0,0,,等下我们关掉房间灯  打开白灯后
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.50,0:01:26.02,ENG,,0,0,0,,I'm curious if you have a prediction for what you might see.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.50,0:01:26.02,CHN,,0,0,0,,我很好奇你能不能预测出看到的情形呢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.52,0:01:30.17,ENG,,0,0,0,,Well, there will be some scattering I suppose
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.52,0:01:30.17,CHN,,0,0,0,,{\3c&H005040&}嗯  我猜会有一些散射
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.62,0:01:32.15,ENG,,0,0,0,,but then if we're just looking at the tube
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.62,0:01:32.15,CHN,,0,0,0,,{\3c&H005040&}但如果只是盯着圆管来看
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.77,0:01:37.60,ENG,,0,0,0,,we're not applying any kind of filter to just look into it to the tube.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.77,0:01:37.60,CHN,,0,0,0,,{\3c&H005040&}也不加什么滤光片  直接看圆管的话
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.60,0:01:39.95,ENG,,0,0,0,,So I mean my instinct is nothing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.60,0:01:39.95,CHN,,0,0,0,,{\3c&H005040&}我的直觉是  无事发生
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.95,0:01:41.78,ENG,,0,0,0,,you know, nothing will happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.95,0:01:41.78,CHN,,0,0,0,,{\3c&H005040&}就啥也不会发生
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.78,0:01:43.51,ENG,,0,0,0,,That would have been my guess too
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.78,0:01:43.51,CHN,,0,0,0,,我当时也是这样猜的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.51,0:01:47.76,ENG,,0,0,0,,but let me just show you what it looks like when we turn off the room lights and we turn on the lamp.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.51,0:01:47.76,CHN,,0,0,0,,不过我直接演示吧  关掉房间灯打开白灯后会如何
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.19,0:01:53.76,ENG,,0,0,0,,And then if you turn the initial polarizer you can kind of see those stripes
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.19,0:01:53.76,CHN,,0,0,0,,此时转动第一个偏振片  就会看到这些色带
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.76,0:01:56.38,ENG,,0,0,0,,those diagonal Stripes seem to walk up the tube.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.76,0:01:56.38,CHN,,0,0,0,,斜向色带似乎会沿着圆管走
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.34,0:02:01.35,ENG,,0,0,0,,Oh, wow. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.34,0:02:01.35,CHN,,0,0,0,,哇
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.34,0:02:01.35,ENG,,0,0,0,,But why diagonal?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.34,0:02:01.35,CHN,,0,0,0,,但为什么是斜的呢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.34,0:02:01.35,ENG,,0,0,0,,Exactly, why diagonal?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.34,0:02:01.35,CHN,,0,0,0,,问得好  为什么会斜呢
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.35,0:02:04.55,ENG,,0,0,0,,But why anything
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.35,0:02:04.55,CHN,,0,0,0,,但为什么啊
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.35,0:02:04.55,ENG,,0,0,0,,I mean why anything?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.35,0:02:04.55,CHN,,0,0,0,,为什么会有这一切啊
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.02,0:02:07.50,ENG,,0,0,0,,Something about the interaction with sugar water
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.02,0:02:07.50,CHN,,0,0,0,,跟糖水发生某种互动后
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.50,0:02:10.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,separates the light out into these different bands of color.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.50,0:02:10.72,CHN,,0,0,0,,光被分成了不同的色带
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.25,0:02:13.68,ENG,,0,0,0,,but it does so in this really intriguing way

Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.68,0:02:18.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,with the colors appear to form these spiral helixes down the tube.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.68,0:02:18.18,CHN,,0,0,0,,颜色沿着圆管  形成了螺旋的形状
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.39,0:02:21.77,ENG,,0,0,0,,and the other thing I want to draw your attention to
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.39,0:02:21.77,CHN,,0,0,0,,另一个请注意看的点是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.77,0:02:26.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,is the color that's coming out of the tube after it passes through that second filter.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.77,0:02:26.12,CHN,,0,0,0,,通过第二个偏振片后  从圆管出来的色彩
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.97,0:02:31.47,ENG,,0,0,0,,As we rotate the first filter, you rotate through a family of distinct hues.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.97,0:02:31.47,CHN,,0,0,0,,不断转动第一个偏振片  就会看到一系列不同的色调
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.03,0:02:33.73,ENG,,0,0,0,,And it doesn't have to be the first filter
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.03,0:02:33.73,CHN,,0,0,0,,而且不只是第一偏振片
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.73,0:02:38.02,ENG,,0,0,0,,if you rotate that second filter you also rotate through these various different colors.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.73,0:02:38.02,CHN,,0,0,0,,当你转动第二偏振片时  也会看到各种颜色
