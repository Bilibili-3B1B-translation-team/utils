Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.28,0:01:04.62,ENG,,0,0,0,,is that charges with the same sign tend to repel each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.28,0:01:04.62,CHN,,0,0,0,,或许就是电荷同性相斥
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.62,0:01:08.50,ENG,,0,0,0,,And the strength of this force depends a lot on the distance between them.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.62,0:01:08.50,CHN,,0,0,0,,而这种力的强度  很大程度上取决于两者的间距
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.50,0:01:09.68,ENG,,0,0,0,,If your charges are close,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.50,0:01:09.68,CHN,,0,0,0,,如果电荷很近

Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.20,0:01:15.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,but it decays very rapidly as these particles go away from each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.20,0:01:15.92,CHN,,0,0,0,,但是随着这些粒子相互远离  这种排斥力会迅速减弱
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.65,0:01:19.85,ENG,,0,0,0,,Specificaly, here's how you might see this written down as an equation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.65,0:01:19.85,CHN,,0,0,0,,具体来说  你可以将这个问题写成公式
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.85,0:01:21.42,ENG,,0,0,0,,known as Coulomb's law.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.85,0:01:21.42,CHN,,0,0,0,,它就是库仑定律
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.42,0:01:24.81,ENG,,0,0,0,,The force is proportional to the charge of both of the particles
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.81,0:01:26.77,ENG,,0,0,0,,where it's common to use the letter Q.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.77,0:01:28.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,There are some constants in there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.77,0:01:28.20,CHN,,0,0,0,,那里有一些常数
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.20,0:01:32.00,ENG,,0,0,0,,which for our purposes we can just think of as one big proportionality constant
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.20,0:01:32.00,CHN,,0,0,0,,我们可以把它们看作一个大的比例常数
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.00,0:01:33.47,ENG,,0,0,0,,and the important fact is that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.00,0:01:33.47,CHN,,0,0,0,,重要的是
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.47,0:01:38.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,you've got this 1 divided by r² term where r is the distance between them.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.47,0:01:38.20,CHN,,0,0,0,,这里还有一个 1/r² 的项   其中 r 是两个粒子之间的距离
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.60,0:01:43.07,ENG,,0,0,0,,So, for example, if the distance between them increases by a factor of three,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.60,0:01:43.07,CHN,,0,0,0,,因此举例来说  如果粒子之间的距离增加了 3 倍
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.07,0:01:46.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,the force that they're applying to each other goes down by a factor of nine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.07,0:01:46.92,CHN,,0,0,0,,那它们对彼此施加的力  就会减少到原来的1/9
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.70,0:01:49.95,ENG,,0,0,0,,Another way you might see a law like this written down
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.70,0:01:49.95,CHN,,0,0,0,,另一种对这公式的理解方式
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.95,0:01:52.54,ENG,,0,0,0,,is to focus on just one charged particle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.95,0:01:52.54,CHN,,0,0,0,,是只去关注一个带电粒子
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.54,0:01:57.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,and then say for every point in space, if there was a second charge there,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.54,0:01:57.20,CHN,,0,0,0,,然后问：对于空间中的每一点  如果那里有第二个电荷

Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.20,0:02:01.70,CHN,,0,0,0,,那么第一个电荷会对第二个电荷施加什么力呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.77,0:02:05.19,ENG,,0,0,0,,And instead of describing a force per se,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.77,0:02:05.19,CHN,,0,0,0,,与其描述这个力本身
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.19,0:02:08.57,ENG,,0,0,0,,you might see this written describing what's known as the "Electric Field",
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.19,0:02:08.57,CHN,,0,0,0,,你可能会看到这样的写法  描述所谓的“电场”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.77,0:02:12.85,ENG,,0,0,0,,which is just a way of saying what force would be applied to a unit charge
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.77,0:02:12.85,CHN,,0,0,0,,这只是一种表达单位电荷受力情况的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.22,0:02:15.13,ENG,,0,0,0,,and in this context the word "Field"
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.22,0:02:15.13,CHN,,0,0,0,,“场”在这种语境下
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.13,0:02:18.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,means there is a value associated with every single point in space.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.13,0:02:18.72,CHN,,0,0,0,,意味着空间中的每一个点都有一个对应的值
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.72,0:02:20.40,ENG,,0,0,0,,So, the way I have it written here,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.72,0:02:20.40,CHN,,0,0,0,,因此  按照我这里的写法
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.40,0:02:22.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,it depends on a little vector R
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.40,0:02:22.56,CHN,,0,0,0,,它取决于一个小向量 r
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.56,0:02:26.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,which would be the vector from our charge to a given point in space
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.56,0:02:26.12,CHN,,0,0,0,,也就是从我们的电荷到空间给定点的向量
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.45,0:02:31.02,ENG,,0,0,0,,and the direction of this field at all points is in the same direction as R.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.45,0:02:31.02,CHN,,0,0,0,,而这个场在所有点的方向都与 r 的方向一致
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.10,0:02:35.90,ENG,,0,0,0,,I bring up Coulomb’s law to emphasize that it's not the full story.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.10,0:02:35.90,CHN,,0,0,0,,我提起库仑定律  是为了强调这并不是全部
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.00,0:02:38.47,ENG,,0,0,0,,There are other ways that charges influence each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.00,0:02:38.47,CHN,,0,0,0,,电荷之间还有其他相互影响的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.67,0:02:42.35,ENG,,0,0,0,,For example, here's a phenomenon that this law alone could not explain.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.67,0:02:42.35,CHN,,0,0,0,,例如  库仑定律本身无法解释这样一种现象
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.87,0:02:45.10,ENG,,0,0,0,,If you wiggle one charge up and down,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.87,0:02:45.10,CHN,,0,0,0,,如果你上下摆动一个电荷
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.17,0:02:46.62,ENG,,0,0,0,,then after a little bit of a delay,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.17,0:02:46.62,CHN,,0,0,0,,在稍微延迟后

Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.02,0:02:51.97,ENG,,0,0,0,,will be induced to wiggle up and down as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.02,0:02:51.97,CHN,,0,0,0,,也会受到感应而上下摆动
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.07,0:02:53.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,We can write down a second law,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.07,0:02:53.82,CHN,,0,0,0,,我们可以写下第二条定律
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.95,0:02:57.41,ENG,,0,0,0,,which you might think of as a correction term to be added to Coulomb's law
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.95,0:02:57.41,CHN,,0,0,0,,你可以把它看作是库仑定律的一个修正项
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.41,0:02:59.15,ENG,,0,0,0,,that describes what's going on here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.41,0:02:59.15,CHN,,0,0,0,,用来描述这里发生的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.47,0:03:03.75,ENG,,0,0,0,,Suppose at some point in time, T 0, that first charge is accelerating.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.47,0:03:03.75,CHN,,0,0,0,,假设在某个时间点 t₀  第一个电荷正在加速
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.00,0:03:05.89,ENG,,0,0,0,,Then I'll let time play forward
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.00,0:03:05.89,CHN,,0,0,0,,然后我会让时间开始流动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.89,0:03:08.57,ENG,,0,0,0,,but leave on the screen a kind of ghost of that particle
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.89,0:03:08.57,CHN,,0,0,0,,但在屏幕上留下该粒子的重影
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.57,0:03:13.70,ENG,,0,0,0,,indicating where it was and how it was accelerating at this time T 0.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.70,0:03:15.20,CHN,,0,0,0,,经过一定的延迟后
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.35,0:03:18.00,ENG,,0,0,0,,this causes a force on the second charge
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.35,0:03:18.00,CHN,,0,0,0,,这将对第二个电荷产生一个力
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.00,0:03:21.50,ENG,,0,0,0,,and the equation describing force looks something like this...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.00,0:03:21.50,CHN,,0,0,0,,并且描述力的方程是这样的...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.07,0:03:25.67,ENG,,0,0,0,,So again, it's proportional to the charge of both of the particles.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.07,0:03:25.67,CHN,,0,0,0,,所以同样  它与两个粒子的电荷量成正比
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.95,0:03:29.77,ENG,,0,0,0,,And once more, a common way to write it involves this pile of constants

Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.54,0:03:37.15,ENG,,0,0,0,,is how the force also depends on the distance between the particles.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.54,0:03:37.15,CHN,,0,0,0,,力如何依然取决于粒子之间的距离
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.30,0:03:39.87,ENG,,0,0,0,,But instead of decaying in proportion to R squared,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.30,0:03:39.87,CHN,,0,0,0,,但是  它不是按照 r² 的反比例衰减

Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.10,0:03:42.10,CHN,,0,0,0,,而是只按照 r 的反比例衰减
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.35,0:03:43.86,ENG,,0,0,0,,So, over long distances,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.35,0:03:43.86,CHN,,0,0,0,,因此  在长距离上
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.86,0:03:47.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,this is the force that dominates and Coulomb's law is negligible.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.86,0:03:47.72,CHN,,0,0,0,,这种力占主导地位  而库仑定律可以忽略不计

Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.52,0:03:55.52,CHN,,0,0,0,,但不是看该粒子在当前时间的加速度
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.90,0:04:00.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,it's whatever that acceleration was at some time in the past.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.90,0:04:00.20,CHN,,0,0,0,,而是看过去某个时间的加速度
